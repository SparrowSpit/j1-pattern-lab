## Defaults
- The default view of a Checkbox Toggle is having no option selected (unchecked).
- The default label has a font-weight of bold. 
- If there is a group of checkboxes, more than one checkbox may be selected at a time.


## Optional Features
- A Checkbox Toggle may have an attribute of checked set to it on page load. 
- May be set to disabled


## Accessibility
- Groups of checkboxes should be marked up using the fieldset and legend element. This helps someone using assistive technology to understand the question theyâ€™re answering with the group of checkboxes. The fieldset is placed around the whole group and the legend contains the question. But, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, if a table makes use of checkboxes as a way to select rows of data. Checkboxes in this context would represent an entire row of data in its associated table row. 
- The input itself should be able to receive focus. 
- On focusing the control, the label should be read by the screenreader.
- Always include a unique ID for the input field
- Always include a label that points to the input field's ID
- If a visible label does not work in a given context, add the "sr-only" class to the label tag to visually hide it but still make it readable by screen readers.
     - Consider adding additional screen-reader-only text to a label's text to give additional info to screen reader users. Example: "Name" might make sense to sighted users, but it may be helpful to screen reader users to add "Name(s of system users)" where the text in parentheses is only for screen readers.
