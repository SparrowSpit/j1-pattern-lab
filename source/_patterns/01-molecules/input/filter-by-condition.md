## Description
* This new component provides users the ability to filter by condition option. This filter acts similar to many grid filters such as the filters in Excel and the HandsOn Grid. Users will first pick the condition that they would like to filter by and then enter the numeric value below. Users will also be able to pair two or more conditions in a single filter. An example of this would be input by condition Is not equal to and an additional input by condition Greater than.
