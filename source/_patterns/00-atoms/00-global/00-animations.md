## Description
- Transitions are a presentational effect which allow property changes in CSS values, such as those that may be defined to occur on hover or focus, to occur smoothly over a specified duration rather than happening instantaneously as is the normal behaviour.

## Styling
- There is no external styling to be applied as the transition only affects other styling changes (such as opacity or color) over time. 

## Behavior
- Once activated, the transition should take .3 seconds to complete.

## Responsive Behavior
- N/A

## Defaults

- To add the transition within a component's CSS, use the SASS mix-in transition-default.

## Optional Features

## Accessibility
- Do not use a transition as the only means of conveying information to the user on-screen.
