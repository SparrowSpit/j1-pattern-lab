## Description
* This new component allows users to filter by condition. This design adds filtering similar to many grid systems such as Excel and the Handson Grid. Users will first pick the condition that they would like to filter by and then enter the numeric amount below. Users will also be able to pair two conditions in a single search. An example of this would be Filter by condition Is not equal to and an additional search of Filter by condition Greater than.
